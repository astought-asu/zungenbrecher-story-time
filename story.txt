1. One day on the ASU campus, Dr. Mehlhase was pacing the floor in her schloss.
2. She was awaiting the Baeckerei to open for business that day.
3. After getting herself a croissant, she decided to get in her Porsche and started driving to Flagstaff.
4. Once she arrived at her destination, she went straight for the Biergarten. 
5. Rammstein was playing and she immediately felt calm.
6. So she decided the best thing to order was some Apfelkuchen. 
7. She dropped it onto her lap -- good thing she was wearing her Lederhose!
8. A nearby hund caught a whiff of the fallen apfelkuchen, and charged toward Dr. Melhase!
